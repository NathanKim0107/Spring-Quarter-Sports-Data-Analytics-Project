# Spring Quarter Sports Data Analytics Project
Upload R coding for Bruin Sports Analytics Project in Spring 2022 Quarter

This project will analyze KBO (Korean Baseball Organization) and NPB (Nippon Professional Baseball) player data. We will compare two players from both organization with athletes who moved to the MLB

The two players to be discussed are: Lee Jung Hoo (Center Fielder) for Kiwoom Heroes and Yoshinobu Yamamoto (Starting Pitcher) for the Orix Buffaloes
  We will discuss why those players have garnered much MLB interest and what makes them so unique compared to their peers
